# Spin The Wheel â€“ Django Web App

A fun and interactive **Spin the Wheel** web application built with **Django**, featuring **user authentication**, **daily spin limits**, **streak tracking**, and a **history system** to keep players engaged every day.  

Users type in their own options, and when they spin the wheel, it randomly selects one! ðŸŽ¯

## API Endpoints

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Django 5.x  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Database:** SQLite (Djangoâ€™s default ORM)  
- **Authentication:** Djangoâ€™s built-in auth system  
- **Signals:** Django signals for streak tracking  

---

## How It Works

1. User **signs up** or **logs in**.  
2. A **Profile** is automatically created using Django signals.  
3. On each login:
   - Daily spin count resets.  
   - Streak count updates.  
4. When spinning:
   - A random result is chosen from the userâ€™s custom options.  
   - Spin result is saved in history.  
   - Remaining spins decrease.
